I used to wait for this day<br >
To send well wishes your way.<br >
I used to think of words to say<br >
And silly tricks I could play.<br >

And one day the world caught me,<br >
Making a list for the rest of just another days.<br >

They warned me, you do not exist.<br >
For I did not believe them<br >
I came running to you,<br >
Even you agreed with them.<br >

I could not not believe you.<br >
You’re not here.<br >
Not here.<br >
Here,<br >
I am alone in this wasteland,<br >
A thousand universes from you.<br >

But I haven't forgotten the feel of your skin,<br >
Your mischievous smile.<br >
You’d think thousand universes would be enough.<br >
I guess I’ll keep walking.<br >

After all this time I remembered  of this day,<br >
I came looking for you in the voidness.<br >
This could just be another mirage,<br >
You’ve re-appeared before my sight.<br >

I want to greet you<br >
Yet this silence it too loud.<br >
Your light is covering<br > 
Everything<br >
Around me.<br >
I’m afraid it may imprison me,<br >
Again.<br >

Here, today, I’ll not say any words<br >
And of those wishes unsaid,<br >
I’ll assemble prayers for you<br >
Every day<br >
And every just another day.<br >

Happy Always!<br >
